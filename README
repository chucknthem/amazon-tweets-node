Extracts tweets with amzn.com short URL links from the twitter streaming API. It keeps a running 100 of the most recent tweets with amzn links in application memory, and stores all of the tweets in a mongodb

This project is a sandbox project to help me learn nodejs, mongodb, and the twitter API

Seeing what products from amazon are being tweeted is kinda cool, and might be useful so I decided to open source it. 

Still need to add categorization by amazon domain. Lots of questionable products are been tweeted from amazon.co.jp (wtf japan?) so that should be filtered out

== SETUP ==
 1. You'll need nodejs > 0.2.5 (nodejs.org), this was tested on nodejs 0.4.1

 2. This uses the twitter-node plugin, which you can get using 
    npm install twitter-node
   or from https://github.com/technoweenie/twitter-node

 3. You'll also need the mongodb driver for node
     npm install mongodb
   or from https://github.com/christkv/node-mongodb-native
   
 4. install mongodb (http://mongodb.org/downloads)

== USAGE ==
 1. Set environment variables for a twitter account
   AMZNTWEETS_USER = twitter_username
   AMZNTWEETS_PASSWORD = twitter_password

 2. run 
     node amazon_tweets.js
   this will start a connection with stream.twitter.com and start scanning for amzn.com tweets
   it will also start an http server on port 17484 to serve json data about those tweets
   
 3. open index.html in a browser with decent javascript support to view the top 10 tweeted products in the last hour and a list of 100 most recently tweeted products

 
In localhost:17484/?tophour=20 will give you the top 20 most tweeted products in the last hour
localhost:17484/?callback=foo will return results in a json format style using foo({json_string}) to help with cross domain ajax requests
